# BMI Calculator with Node.js and Express
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Node.js and Express. It provides a web interface where users can enter their weight and height, and it calculates their BMI based on the provided values. The application leverages Express to handle HTTP requests and responses, while the front-end is created using HTML and a basic form. The server-side logic processes the user's input, calculates the BMI, and displays the result back to the user.
